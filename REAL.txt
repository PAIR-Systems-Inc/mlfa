For a long time I didn’t think much of myself. I just assumed I was a little less than other people, and that belief stuck with me. Sometimes it still does.

The first time I remember it hitting me was in third grade. I messed up on this really easy math problem, and the guy sitting next to me looked over and said something like, “What, you got that wrong? You’re so bad at math.” And instead of laughing it off, I believed him. I walked away thinking, yeah, that’s true, I’m not good at math. And once I believed it, I kept repeating it in my head. Even when I got things right, I’d tell myself I wasn’t good at it. So I stopped pushing forward. That way of thinking didn’t just stay with math. It followed me into other things—anytime I was unsure, I was the first one to say to myself, “you can’t do it.” And inevitably I wouldn’t push myself to my limits, because in my head I wasn’t capable of that anyway.

My grandma has always been one of the exceptions to that. She never babied me. She treated me like what I thought and felt actually mattered, even when I was small. With her, I felt taken seriously, and that made me want to take myself seriously too.

I remember visiting her in Ohio in the summer of 2015. Across the street from her house there were monkey bars. I was scared of them, and my sister kept saying I was too little. I believed her the same way I believed that boy in math class. I’d grab the first bar and drop right away, telling myself it was true—I was too little. My grandma didn’t see me that way. Every day she came with me to the park, held me up, and helped me across the bars. She kept at it until one day, on my seventh birthday, I finally made it across by myself. I felt proud, and honestly I don’t think I could have done it without her.

I’m grateful for her because she’s been steady in ways I haven’t been with myself. Getting rid of that old mindset isn’t something you just switch off. But when I think about how she’s always taken me seriously, it makes it easier to push back on those doubts and believe, even a little, that I can do more.
