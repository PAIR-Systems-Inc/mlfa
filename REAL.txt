For the longest time, I've totally doubted myself and not seen myself as much, as in I felt as though I was always less than others, which, for a long time I didn't see as a problem, but now that I think about it, I feel like that has truly limited me and I've definitely made a past, not fully past that, but I've definitely made it past the stage in my life where I literally thought nothing of myself. For example, when I was in third grade had told me you're not that good at math because I got an easy problem wrong. And I was like, yeah, they're right. I'm not good at math. And I believed it.  And that kept repeating in my head. So even if I was good at math, I had convinced myself I wasn’t, so I limited myself and didn’t push forward. And I think that's applicable to so many things. So many different examples in my life where I was the one who was telling myself that I wasn't good at it. I guess it just didn't feel like people took me seriously, And because of that I couldn't take myself seriously. But if there was one person who has always taken me seriously, and who I will always have an infinite amount of gratitude towards, that would be my grandma.  Because I think that she's been the one who's always had some kind of faith in me. She never treated me liek a child. I didn't feel like I was being babied by her.  It felt like she genuinely took me seriously. Like I was like a mini adult and I appreciate that because it felt and still feels good to be seen by her but not as something less. When I was little, but even now, she still encourages me. She doesn't doubt me. She still takes me seriously.  So I remember it was almost 10 years ago now. It was the summer of 2015 and I had gone to Ohio to visit her. And I had this huge fear of monkey bars.  So for here in a park nearby, there would be these monkey bars and I told myself I was going to learn how to cross them, but I was always way too scared. My sister would call me too little. She's like, yeah, you're too little.  You can't cross the monkey bars. And so once again, I think I took that a little too seriously in that, that those words circled in my mind, like, yeah, you're too little. You can't cross the monkey bars. circled my mind, but we'd gone and visited my grandma and she had monkey bars at the park across from her house.  And I told myself I was going to learn how to cross them, but each time I like held onto the first hour, I dropped down, because I was too scared and once again, I believe that I was too little. But my grandma didn't believe I was too little and she believed that I could do it. And I remember every single day she would hold me up there for an hour and she would she would hold hold me and like move me across them with the bars.  And she did that for at least a month. And then I remember it was my seventh birthday and I was like, yeah, I'm older now. I'm not little.  And she was like, yeah, you're not little. You were never. She said something.  I can't really remember now, but she was, but I believe that I was no longer little and she had been telling me that, yes, you could do this. She would repeat that little cornyated, like practice makes perfect. But hearing it from her actually gave me, like, some kind of, you know, belief and hope in myself.  And I remember we'd gone to the park and I finally hung on to those monkey bars and I made it across and like, I don't even know how to describe the kind of joy that I felt from that. Not even joy, but just like. feeling of accomplishment. I was like, yeah, like I did that.  I was the one who crossed across the monkey bars. And I think similarly, even now, like. When what I do doubt myself and I had to think about this really hardly, and it takes a lot of, it takes a lot of effort to like, even come to this realization, or at least for me, it did.  Not like the only person genuinely the only person who's holding me back is myself because I was the one who was repeating that to myself.
