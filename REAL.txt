I remember waking up to the hum of the lawnmower across the street from my grandma’s house. Around nine in the morning I’d press my face against the screen of her bedroom window, smell the cut grass, feel the sticky summer air, and start thinking about the day: scootering around the neighborhood, reading books, eating orange sherbet, but mostly going to the park to try the monkey bars.

I’d promised myself I’d learn to cross those monkey bars because the ones back home felt too scary. But the truth was, I was scared of all of them. My older sister would tell me I was too little, and I believed her. My grandma, though, didn’t agree. She told me practice would make perfect, and I believed her a little more. Every evening she walked me to the park, lifted me up, and moved me across those bars again and again. She didn’t baby me, even though I was six. She treated me like I could actually do it, and somehow that confidence rubbed off.

For weeks I dropped down after the first bar, convinced I’d never make it. But on my seventh birthday, I crossed the whole thing on my own. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that feeling—not just because I made it across, but because my grandma had been right all along. I wasn’t too little.

There have been plenty of times since when I’ve wanted to give up on something, when I’ve convinced myself I just wasn’t capable. But I think about that summer, about the way my grandma stood with me and kept saying I could do it, and I keep going. Realizing that I’m usually the one telling myself I can’t has definitely moved me forward. It’s not something you just switch off—doubt still shows up—but having her steady voice in my memory makes me push anyway.
