I remember waking up to the hum of the lawnmower mowing the lawn of the park across my grandma’s street. It would be around 9 in the morning and I would get up and walk over to the window facing the park and press my face against the screen. I could smell the freshly cut grass, and feel the warm stickiness of the humidity on my face and I would think about what I was going to do that day: scootering around the neighborhood, reading books, eating Orange Sherbert, but most importantly going to the park to try to cross the monkey bars. I had told myself I would learn how to cross the monkey bars at my grandma’s house because the ones back home were too scary. And I reminded myself of that each day, but truth be told, I was still scared of monkey bars, no matter where I was. I remember my older sister telling me I was too little to cross those bars, and I believed her but my grandma always told me that practice would make perfect and I guess I believed her. She would come with me to the park every evening and lift me up and walk me across the bars for at least an hour. And I remember thinking that I was never going to be able to make it across, until I actually did, on my seventh birthday, and I think that I will always thank my grandma for that. Because she always has always encouraged me to do things even when I don’t feel like I am capable. She never babied me even when I was liek six, and hearing her have that cofndinece in me gave me confidence too. There have been a lot of moments in my life where I wanted to give up on something, beuacse I had convinced myself that I just wasn’t capable, but I think about hte cofndince that my grandma has always had in me, how she was right all along, that Iwasn’t too little, and that I can cross those bars, and i still do today. I still cross the monkey bars, the problems and struggles in my life, even when I think that I cant.
