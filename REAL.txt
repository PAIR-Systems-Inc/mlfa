I remember waking up to the hum of the lawnmower mowing the lawn of the park across my grandma’s street. It would be around 9 in the morning and I would get up and walk over to the window facing the park and press my face against the screen. I could smell the freshly cut grass, and feel the warm stickiness of the humidity over my face and I heard the morning birds chirping away. I kept my face against that screen, taking in the sounds, but also thinking about what I was going to do that day: scootering around the neighborhood, reading books, eating Orange Sherbert, but most importantly going to the park to try to cross the monkey bars. I had told myself I would learn how to cross the monkey bars at my grandma’s house because the ones back home were too scary. And I reminded myself of that each day, but truth be told, I was still scared of monkey bars, no matter where I was, and it made me extremely upset. My sister would call me too little, but my grandma was the one who never lost “hope” in me. She would hold me up for an hour taking me back and forth across those bars, and she told me the very common adage of “practice makes perfect,” and hearing that coming from her sepcicailly, puhsed me forward. And I think it’s because no matter how young I was she would always take me seriously, and even now, she takes me seriously. That summer, on my seventh birthday, I was able to cross the monkey bars for the first time, all by myself, and I will always thank my grandma for that, becasueshe was the one who pushed me, who never doubted me, who made me feel liek I could do it. And I’ll always thank her for that, for being able to take me and my concerns seriously no matter how young I have been, because her words of encouragement have always pushed me forward, even now.
